# Madlibs
This is my first project in Python. Its simple and easy. Maybe the smallest ever project.
This is just a basic version of madlibs. We can make it bigger by making improvements and adding long stories.

# What are Mad libs?
Mad Libs are stories with words removed and replaced by blank spaces. One player acts as the “reader” and asks the other players, who haven’t seen the story, to fill in the blanks with adjectives, nouns, exclamations, colors, adjectives, and more. These words are inserted into the blanks and then the story is read aloud to hilarious results.  There are no winners or losers, only laughter.

# What I learned new?
I learned a new way to concatenate two strings. 
f"String {variable}"
This is called 'f'strings.
